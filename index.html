    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <h4>Community Service</h4>
    <p>
        I have completed a total of 44 hours of community service over my high school career. 
        These hours have been spent at many non-profit organisations such as the Johannesburg Zoo, 
        CHOC (Childhood Cancer Foundation SA) and JAM (Joint Aid Management).
    </p>
    <h4>Leadership</h4>
    <p>
        Throughout my school career, I actively participated in various leadership camps, 
        where I gained valuable insights into the process of social influence. These experiences
        taught me the importance of self-awareness, effective communication, empathy, integrity, 
        and the art of delegation as fundamental aspects of leadership. Moreover, as the vice-chair
        of the first years committee at Stellenbosch for the Capri PSO, I had the opportunity to develop
        my creative thinking skills and devise innovative ways to foster a sense of community during
        the latter part of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021.
    </p>
    <h3>Achievements</h3>
    <h4>Academic</h4>
    <p>
        I achieved academic certificates throughout my high school career that awarded me academic colours in 2020.
    </p>
    <h4>Music</h4>
    <p>
        Although I started my musical journey later than some, music has become an integral part of my daily life. 
        In my primary school years, I successfully completed my grade 3 exam in electric guitar. However, it was 
        during my high school years that music truly became a significant part of my world. I began learning piano 
        at the age of 14 and cello at the age of 15. Since then, I have accomplished a distinction in Trinity 
        grade 3 cello and a distinction in Trinity grade 5 piano. Participation in the school choir and 
        symphony orchestra during my high school career awarded me half colours for music. 
    </p>
    <h4>Sport</h4>
    <p>
        Since the age of 8 Karate embedded long lasting principles of disciple and mental strength 
        into my character. Participation in world championships allowed me to travel to Japan, Italy and 
        Malta where I proudly secured 2 gold medals, 1 silver medal and 1 bronze medal. Furthermore throughout my 
        schooling career I had the opportunity to participate in a variety of sports which gave me the space to 
        learn team spirit and working together on a common goal.
